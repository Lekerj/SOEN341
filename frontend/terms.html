              Bookings made through our website, and our your rights and obligations in relation to such bookings, are governed by these terms and conditions.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              You will have to agree to these terms and conditions before you place an order on our website.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              Any statutory rights that you may have as a consumer are not affected by these terms and conditions.

            <ul class="mb-2">
              <li>  (a) ‚Äúwe‚Äù means ConEvents (and ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúour‚Äù should be construed accordingly);</li>
              <li>  (b) ‚Äúyou‚Äù means our customer or prospective customer under these terms and conditions (and ‚Äúyour‚Äù should be construed accordingly);</li>

            <h2 class="text-left mb-2">3. Order process</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
              The advertising of bookings on our website constitutes an ‚Äúinvitation to treat‚Äù rather than a contractual offer.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              No contract will come into force between you and ConEvent unless and until we accept your order.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              To make a booking through our website, the following steps must be taken:
              <ul class="mb-2">
                <li>You must click ‚Äúbuy tickets‚Äù in relation to the relevant event;</li>
                <li>If you are a new customer, you must create an account with us and log in; if you are an existing customer, you must enter your login details;</li>
                <li>Once you are logged in, you must consent to these terms and conditions; you will then be transferred to our payment service provider‚Äôs website, and our payment service provider will handle your payment;</li>
                <li>We will then send you an initial acknowledgement; and finally, we will either send you an order confirmation (at which point your order will become a binding contract) or we will confirm by email that we are unable to meet your order.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              You will have the opportunity to identify and correct input errors prior to making your order by contacting us.

              Our prices are quoted on our website.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              We will from time to time change the prices quoted on our website, but this will not affect contracts that have previously come into force.
